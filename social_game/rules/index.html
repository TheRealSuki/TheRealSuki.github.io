                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed italic">
                    A creeping darkness has fallen over our once-peaceful town. Mysterious forces are at play, and whispers in the shadows suggest that one of our own has been possessed by a powerful Demon! This foul entity works from the inside, aided by secret accomplices who walk among us during the day. Trust no one. The fate of the town rests in your hands.

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    At the beginning of the game, each player secretly receives a character token from the bag. You must read your role and ability without showing it to anyone else. Your role determines your team and your special powers.

                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-100">1. Day Phase</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed ml-4">
                            During the day, all living players can openly discuss who they suspect is evil. You are free to share information (or lies!) with the group. Players may also request private conversations with others, away from the main group, to share secrets or coordinate strategies.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed ml-4">
                            Any player may choose to nominate another player for execution. Once a player is nominated, all living players vote. If the nominee receives more than half of the votes, they are marked for execution. However, the nomination process can continue. If a subsequent nominee gets even more votes, they become the new player to be executed. The player with the most votes (and more than half) at the end of the day is executed.

                        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed ml-4">
                            All players close their eyes and go to "sleep". The Game Master will then wake individual players one by one, prompting them to use their nightly abilities with hand signals. To prevent players from hearing who is woken up, music will be played. The Game Master will also move around the room to obscure the positions of active players.

                 <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">There are three factions in the game: The Good Team (Townsfolk & Outsiders), and The Evil Team (Demon & Minions).</p>

                    <li><span class="font-bold text-blue-400">The Good Team</span> wins if the Demon is executed by a vote. Even if you are an Outsider, you are on the Good team (unless a role ability says otherwise).</li>
                    <li><span class="font-bold text-red-400">The Evil Team</span> wins when the number of evil players is equal to the number of good players, or when nothing can prevent this from happening. The Imp may kill one player each night to work towards this goal.</li>
